            Summary
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring Powerline technician. I have worked in a few
            industries, and bring my knowledge and experience with me. I
            attended Southern Alberta Institute of Technology's - IT
            Telecommunication program and I have been working for Telus
            since I left the program. My current job involves climbing poles
            and stringing fiber optic drop lines to houses and businesses. I
            am seeking out an opportunity to change my career into
            something more fitting for myself in the Powerline field.
            My skillset strongly focuses on: troubleshooting, problem
            solving, critical thinking, documentation, and communication.
            My final project at SAIT involves design, automation, and
            programming of a water filtration machine prototype,
            outfitted with a SCADA system.
